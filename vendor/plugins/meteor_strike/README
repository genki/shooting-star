MeteorStrike
============
  by Genki Takiuchi <takiuchi@drecom.co.jp>

This plugin provides an implementation of comet client corresponding to
comet server named ShootingStar.

INSTALL:
  You need to configure this plugin by database.yml like this;

  development:
    database: db/development.sqlite3
    timeout: 5000
    shooting_star:
      server: 127.0.0.1:8080
      shooter: druby://localhost:7123

  server is the host serving comet which is accessed from client browser.
  shooter is the URI serving druby object which is accessed from Rails
  application.

  In order to keep security, shooter should be private address.

USAGE:
  In the view rhtml file, you can connect to the server by calling one helper
  method below:

  <%=
  meteor_strike 'channel/name',
    :uid => user_identifier,
    :tag => [tag1, tag2],
    :event => %Q{
      switch(params.event){
      case 'enter':
        /* params.uid is entered to the channel with params.tag */
        break;
      case 'leave':
        /* params.uid is left from the channel with params.tag */
        break;
      case 'update':
        /* params.uid is updated status in the channel */
        break;
      }
    }
  %>

  Second parameter is optional.
  :uid should be unique number or string which identifing user.
  :tag acts as sub-channel.
  :event is a javascript handling events from server.
